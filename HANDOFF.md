# Handoff

**State and what is in flight, and nothing else.** What the site is and what is
next are `STRUCTURE.md`; how to work here is `CLAUDE.md`. Finished work is in
the commit message — `git log --grep` searches it. `CLAUDE.md`'s "Which
document takes it" is the rule this file obeys.

**Verify anything here before you build on it**, and **read a number from the
run rather than from this file**. It was 573 lines once, nine tenths of it
narratives of finished sittings, and the trim that cut it kept a "known and
unfixed" list on the strength of its heading — one of whose four items had been
fixed three days earlier.

## State

`bash scripts/state.sh` is the truth about what has landed — `git status` lies
here, because a PAT push never updates `origin/main`.

- `npm test` for the unit count, `node scripts/locale-coverage.mjs` for pack
  gaps, `scripts/build-manifest.mjs` for the corpus size. None of them is
  written down here.
- **A full browser run fails about four of ~980 at six workers, and it is a
  different four each time.** Treat them as this desk until `--repeat-each=6`
  alone says otherwise — that comparison is what separated three real defects
  from the noise on 2026-09-15. The shelf-swipe flake is the known one and is
  the test's fault, not the page's (`STRUCTURE.md` §6).
- The PAT is at `C:\Users\matei\Documents\Agios Website Ex\update git.txt`.
  `bash scripts/push.sh` pushes and reads the CI run in one step.

## In flight

**The document cut, uncommitted.** Six documents are gone — the old plan, the
old to-do, the reverted rebuild's two, and the scratchpad's three — and every
citation to them has been retired from `src/`, `e2e/`, `tests/` and `scripts/`.
`STRUCTURE.md` is what replaced the first two. The plan's test is now
`tests/structure.test.mjs`, the saint-slug guard moved to
`tests/corpus-break.test.mjs`, and `scripts/tokens-table.mjs` prints §3's four
token tables from `tokens.css`. `git log` has the rest; nothing is pushed.

**The Daily desktop redesign is the next job** and the design has not been
given. `eae39cd` took the page back to `f31520a`, the last commit before the
2026-09-12 rebuild.

## Three things git cannot tell you

**`android/app/src/main/assets/public/` holds a built copy of the site from
2026-09-05** — before the rename and before the rebuild, so its masthead reads
"Daily Dox" and its Daily page is the week rail. It is **gitignored and
untracked**: the only copy of that state outside git, and `npm run app:sync`
would overwrite it.

**Two visual baselines exist under `shots/`, which is gitignored, so nothing
else records that they are there. Never re-shoot either.**

- `baseline-before-daily-rebuild` — 16 tiles of `/saints` from before the
  rebuild.
- `baseline-new-daily-2026-09-15` — 4 tiles of `/` at 360 and 1280 in both
  themes, the rebuilt page as it stood the moment before the revert.

```bash
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 node scripts/contact-sheet.mjs --still --routes=/saints \
  --widths=360,768,1280,1440 --themes=day,vigil --langs=en,ru
node scripts/tile-diff.mjs compare before-daily-rebuild
```

`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` is not optional: without it every shot fails and
`tile-diff` archives stale tiles as the baseline. That happened twice and both
times the output read as success.

**`4983e72` is titled as a docs fix and also carries 3,400 lines of spec
deletions**, swept in by a bare `git commit` after `git add`. The tree is right,
the history is not. It is unpushed, so a rebase would still tidy it.
